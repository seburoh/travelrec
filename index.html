                <p>This site encourages travel by providing interesting images about different places which may exist in
                    the
                    world we live in. Not a different world, no pictures exist here of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
                    Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune. Nor do any pictures exist on this site of Pluto, Narnia, Middle Earth,
                    Terra, Cadia, The Warp, or Hyrule. While Terra may technically be the Earth within the lore of
                    specific
                    fictional franchises, fictional franchises to not represent places on which travel could be
                    performed
                    within the real space of planet Earth, and thus are categorically not on this platform. This
                    platform
                    only provides locations which exist on Earth, as represented from non-fictional material. However if
                    there is fictional material which bases itself on non-fictional material, and is set on planet
                    Earth,
                    there may be an overlap of places which could and could not be on this platform. This paradox is
                    solved
                    by specific counsel of the web domain elders which convene once every seven parsecs. The elders then
                    decide arbitrarily on which items shall and shall not be allowed on this platform through trial by
                    combat on Runeterra, on Summoner's Rift. The editors of this description do acknowledge the possible
                    confusion in that parsec is a unit of distance, not of time, and thus is a potentially inaccurate
                    measurement to provide when describing when the elders meet. However, the elders are all actually on
                    different trajectories from each other and do actually meet once every 7 parsecs, as this is when
                    their
                    gaming laptops are within range of the celestial wifi towers, allowing them to connect to the
                    internet
                    and host Teams meetings and trial by combat to decide these matters. We appreciate your
                    understanding.
